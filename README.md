## Example Usage

The `area` module is a demo module to showcase the use of Sphinx documentation.

Here's a quick example of using this module:

```python
import lib.area as area

side = 5
print(f"Area of square with side length of {side} is {area.square(side)}.")
```

The output of the above code would look something like this:

```
Area of square with side length of 5 is 25.
```
